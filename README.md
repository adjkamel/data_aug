# Data Augmentation for Land Cover Classification Using Generative Adversarial Networks
This repository contains code for the paper [Data Augmentation for Land Cover Classification Using Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/csmember/data_aug)

#### Requirement
The code has been run on windows with:

- Python 3.7
- tensorflow 2.0
- CUDA Version: 11.1

### Run
- Run GAN.py to generate a new images based on a dataset of images (SPARCS) stored in ./images
- Run CGAN.py to generate a new images based on a dataset of images (SPARCS) stored in ./images
#### Dataset 
[SPARCS dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/spatial-procedures-automated-removal-cloud-and-shadow-sparcs)

#### Models

#### Results
A screen shot of all 200 generated images. Some of them are in ./gnenerated_images
